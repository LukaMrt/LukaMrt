## 🦸‍ Some stuff about me

I'm 21 and I'm a french student at [INSA Lyon]([https://univ-lyon1.fr/](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/)). I like sport 🎾 and music 🥁.

I really like to study science to understand how the world is working.

## 💻 Development

I started to experiment development projects when I was 15. I enjoy to try some things and discover by myself new technologies. 

I'm very interested in the domain of software architecture. I explore this question experimenting little projects such as my pinned projects (you can see them below).
