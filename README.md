## 🦸‍ Some stuff about me

I'm 17 and I'm a french student in the [Galileo high school, Vienne](https://galilee.ent.auvergnerhonealpes.fr/). I like sport 🎾 and music 🥁, you can listen my favorite songs right now with me :

I really like to study science to understand how the world is working.

## 💻 Developpment

I started to experiment developpment projects when I was 15. I enjoy to try some things and discover by myself new technologies.
