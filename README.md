## 🦸‍ Some stuff about me

I'm 18 and I'm a french student in the [Claude Bernard University, Lyon](https://univ-lyon1.fr/). I like sport 🎾 and music 🥁, you can listen my favorite songs right now with me :

I really like to study science to understand how the world is working.

## 💻 Development

I started to experiment development projects when I was 15. I enjoy to try some things and discover by myself new technologies. 

I'm very interested in the domain of software architecture. I explore this question experimenting little projects such as my pinned projects (you can see them below).

Today I often use Java but I'm learning python to extend my knowledge. My current goal is to develop my website and here it is : [http://lukamaret.com/](https://lukamaret.com/). Feel free to contact me (maret.luka@gmail.com or discord or whatever you want) if you find a bug or just want to give me an advice for this website.
